# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Database Schema Retrieval
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the existing database schema retrieval functionality implemented in Task 7.6 with additional features.
# Details:
Building upon the existing implementation from Task 7.6 (getDatabaseSchema), which already handles:
1. Database schema information retrieval via Cloud Function
2. SQL queries for extracting table definitions, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes
3. Data models for schema information
4. Error handling mechanisms
5. Table and column comment extraction

This task has successfully implemented the following additional features:
1. Schema caching mechanism in Firestore to prevent unnecessary database queries
2. Schema refresh functionality allowing users to explicitly update schema information
3. Large schema retrieval with pagination for better performance
4. Schema version tracking to maintain history of schema changes
5. Schema change detection between refreshes to highlight modifications
6. User interface for visualizing schema information and changes

# Test Strategy:
Test the new caching mechanism to verify it properly stores and retrieves schema information from Firestore. Verify the schema refresh functionality correctly updates cached data. Test pagination with large schemas to ensure complete retrieval without performance issues. Validate that schema version tracking correctly identifies and logs changes between versions. Test schema change detection to confirm it accurately identifies modifications. Verify the UI correctly displays schema information and changes.
