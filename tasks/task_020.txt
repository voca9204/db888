# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Firebase Cloud Functions for Database Operations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and deploy Cloud Functions for secure database operations and query execution.
# Details:
Most of the Firebase Cloud Functions have already been implemented as part of Tasks 7 and 8. The following functions are now in place:

1. Database connection testing (testConnection)
2. Database connection management (saveDbConnection, getDbConnections, deleteDbConnection)
3. Query execution with parameters (executeQuery)
4. Database schema retrieval (getDatabaseSchema)
5. Schema version management (getSchemaVersions, getSchemaVersion, getSchemaChanges)

All functions include:
- Security authentication and permission checks
- Error handling and logging
- Caching mechanisms
- Pagination where appropriate

# Test Strategy:
All functions have been tested with various inputs. Security rules have been verified to prevent unauthorized access. Error handling has been confirmed to work correctly. Performance has been tested with large operations, and concurrent function execution has been validated.
