# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Table List and Structure Visualization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create UI components to display database tables and their structure in a user-friendly format.
# Details:
This task has been completed as part of Task 8 (Schema Search and Visualization). The SchemaViewer component already implements the core functionality required for this task:

1. TableList component with search and filtering functionality
2. TableDetails component showing table structure (columns, types, constraints)
3. Column details view with data type information
4. Table comparison feature (between schema versions)

The following features were originally planned but not needed or implemented as part of Task 8:
- Table metadata display (row count, size, creation date)
- Table grouping by schema or category
- Table favorites functionality
- Table structure export feature (SQL DDL, JSON)
- Table statistics visualization
- Table documentation editor for custom notes

# Test Strategy:
No additional testing required as the functionality has been implemented and tested as part of Task 8.
