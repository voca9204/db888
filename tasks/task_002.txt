# Task ID: 2
# Title: Set Up Firebase Project and Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Firebase services for authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, and hosting using the existing Firebase project.
# Details:
The Firebase project has already been created with the following configuration:

```javascript
// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyD2RY02pN2RrhT8Qt2hTSEilRqV4JAbCR0",
  authDomain: "db888-67827.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "db888-67827",
  storageBucket: "db888-67827.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "888497598316",
  appId: "1:888497598316:web:ad0cb0364d906c26658d49"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

Remaining steps:
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
3. Initialize Firebase in the project: `firebase init`
4. Select Firestore, Functions, Hosting, and Authentication
5. Install Firebase SDK: `npm install firebase`
6. Create src/firebase/config.ts file with the provided Firebase configuration
7. Set up environment variables for Firebase config
8. Configure Firebase security rules for Firestore

# Test Strategy:
Verify Firebase connection by testing authentication flow. Confirm Firestore read/write operations work in development environment. Ensure environment variables are properly loaded.
