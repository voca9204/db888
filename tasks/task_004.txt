# Task ID: 4
# Title: Set Up React Router and Application Routes
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement React Router v6 for navigation and define the application's route structure.
# Details:
1. Install React Router: `npm install react-router-dom`
2. Create a router configuration in src/router/index.tsx
3. Define main routes:
   - / (Dashboard)
   - /login (Authentication)
   - /database (Database connection management)
   - /schema (Database schema visualization)
   - /tables (Table browser)
   - /query-builder (Query builder)
   - /templates (Search templates)
   - /results (Query results)
   - /settings (User settings)
4. Implement route guards for authenticated routes
5. Create layout components for different sections
6. Set up navigation components (Navbar, Sidebar)
7. Implement breadcrumb navigation

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation between routes. Verify route guards prevent unauthorized access. Test browser back/forward navigation. Ensure routes are correctly rendered with appropriate components.
